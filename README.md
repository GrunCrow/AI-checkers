I'm GrunCrow and here it's my laboratory implementation for the course Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering.

The Laboratory consists on the implementation of a zero-sum game with the minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms.

The board implementation has been done following the Tutorial of Tech with Tim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnd3RfeG3NM), later some modifications have been added.
